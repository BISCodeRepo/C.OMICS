# About Group Comparison
In this page, you can compare the target with grouping by meta information of NMF cluster (ex: sex, DX, Subtype, etc.)

You can choose the target in protein/RNA/phosphosite/acetylsite.

The t-test (Test statistic) is divided by the number of groups.
If the number of groups is 2, t-test is progressing by the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (= Mann-Whitney U-test).
Moreover, if the number of groups is over 3, it is progressing by the Kruskal-Wallis test (= One way ANOVA on rank).
